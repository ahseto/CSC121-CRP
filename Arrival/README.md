Summary: Arrival is a web-based application to allow Harvey Mudd students to
determine whether the mail room is currently open. It will also display the
current status of various mail carriers.

Users: Arrival is designed for the Harvey Mudd student body, and will be
updated by the mail room staff.

MVP: Arrival displays the current open or closed status of the mail room. It
should display various mail carriers and their delivery status, and it should
be easily updatable.

Functionality: Harvey Mudd students are constantly busy with classes and
homework. The majority of the students have experienced the frustration
of walking across campus to be greeted by a closed mail room. Arrival is
designed so that students can easily check the status of the mail room via
the internet. In addition, Arrival is designed such that students can also
verify which mail carriers have arrived allowing students to predict whether
their package has been delivered.
